# Lost-Place
Lost Place is a game made by 6 people including me during BGDC Talent Group Program (also the first real game I programed)

Lost place is a survival game about a detective who wakes up in a dark room. The ambient of the game is exploration of liminal space, and as you navigate through the maze, you'll confront dangers, all while you try to escape.

# Story
You are a lost detective, waking up in a strange room where boundaries between reality and imagination fade, completely devoid of memories on how you got here. But you know that, in order to escape escape, you must locate a key within the labyrinth-like mansion while confronting the many dangerous creatures that resides there.

# Gameplay 
The player must locate a key within the labyrint in order to escape, armed with only a gun, the player must strategically defeat the creatures in this mansion to keep forging ahead.  While navigating the maze, various resources will be encountered, such as: medkits, glowsticks, and ammunitions. Resources and stamina management are crucial, demanding player to make the right decision to escape safely.
