# Lost-Place
Lost Place is a game made by 6 people including me during BGDC Talent Group Program (also the first real game I programed) <br>

Lost place is a survival game about a detective who wakes up in a dark room. The ambient of the game is exploration of liminal space, and as you navigate through the maze, you'll confront dangers, all while you try to escape. <br>
